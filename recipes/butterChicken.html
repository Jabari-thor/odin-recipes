            <h2>Recipe Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat extra virgin olive oil.  Add diced onions and stir regularly, cooking until the onions are translucent –about four minutes.
                <p></p>
                <li>Add the butter and allow it to melt completely.<br>Then stir in the ginger and garlic, cooking for about 30 seconds to a minute or until fragrant.<br>Be careful not to burn it.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Add the chicken and cook, stirring often until the chicken is no longer pink on the outside, about 2 minutes.<br>No need to cook it all the way through as it will continue cooking as you add the rest of the ingredients and simmer the recipe.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Now stir in the garam masala, chili powder, salt and black pepper.<br>Then pour in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, lemon juice, yogurt and half and half.  Stir to combine fully.<br>Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes to allow the sauce to reduce.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>The sauce will reduce but still be quite saucy. Serve with rice and naan.</li>
