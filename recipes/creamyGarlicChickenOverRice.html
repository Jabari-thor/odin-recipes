                <li>Season the chicken with salt, garlic powder and pepper.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, parmesan cheese. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture; shake off excess.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Swirl pan to coat evenly. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Fry 2-3 chicken breasts until golden on each side, cooked through and no longer pink.<br>(about 4-5 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer to a warm plate. Set aside.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Wipe pan over with a sheet of paper towel. Repeat with remaining oil, butter and chicken breasts.<br>When cooked, transfer the chicken onto the same plate.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium. Sauté the onion in the remaining oil/juices in the pan until softened. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Smash 6 whole cloves of garlic with the blunt edge of the back of a knife.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Add the remaining oil to the pan and heat through, mixing it through the onions.<br>Sauté smashed garlic cloves and whole garlic cloves until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.<br>Add the broth to deglaze the pan. Scrape up any browned bits and let simmer and reduce to half, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour in the cream.<br>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer for about 2-3 minutes, combining all of the flavours together.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Mix in the parmesan cheese. Continue cooking gently for about 2-3 minutes until cheese melts, while stirring occasionally.<br>Season with salt and pepper to your taste.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Add the chicken back into the pan and let simmer for a further 2-3 minutes to thicken the sauce to your liking.<br>The chicken breast will soak up all of the delicious flavours.</li>
                <p></p>
