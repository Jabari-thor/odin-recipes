            <h2>What did the trendy cocktail say to the classic cocktail? "I'm glad that you're Old Fashioned.".</h2>
            <p>Even if you know nothing about cocktails, chances are you've at least heard of an Old Fashioned.<br>Made with just four ingredients – whiskey, sugar, Angostura bitters, and an optional (but recommended) orange peel or Luxardo cherry garnish,<br>the Old Fashioned is up there with other cocktail greats like the Manhattan, Negroni, and Sazerac.</p>
            <p>It's super simple to make, as is appropriate for a cocktail designed to highlight its main ingredient – whiskey!</p>
