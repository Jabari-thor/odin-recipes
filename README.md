# odin-recipes

This is one of the first project's im going to be building within the Odin Project

It is going to be a recipes list and we are going to put to test the knowledge I have gained thus far in HTML/CSS

I learned how to finally update/edit files in the terminal will make it easy to progress and update my README.md file straight from the terminal and not have to constantly open up the file via GUI.

Respectfully,

-Lets get this learning rocking!

-----------The Recipes we have to offer are:-----------
1. Chef's Bangin' Butter Chicken
2. Chef's Creamy Garlic Chicken Over Rice
3. The Trust, Good and Faithful, Chef's Old Fashioned!!!!
